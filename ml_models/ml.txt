Mathematical Transformations
Log Transformation – Used for skewed distributions (e.g., stock prices).
Power Transformation (Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson) – Normalizes skewed data.
Polynomial Features – Adds squared/cubed terms to capture non-linearity.
Reciprocal & Square Root – Handles heavy-tailed distributions.


Date/Time Transformations
Extract day of week, month, year, quarter for seasonal trends.
Cyclical Encoding (e.g., sin(time) and cos(time)) for periodic data.
